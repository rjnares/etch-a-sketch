# Etch-A-Sketch

This is a basic etch-a-sketch type web application created as a project assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

## Project Description

The project consists of a simple N x N grid where N is any value between 1 and 100 (inclusive). This grid is initially 16 x 16 but can be resized by clicking a button at the top which prompts the user for a new dimension size. Hovering over any grid cell will change its color in a couple ways:
* Every hover interaction will produce a new, randomly generated color for the cell
* The initial opacity for a hover interaction will be 0, but every subsequent hover interaction will increase it by 10% until max opacity is reached, at which point, it will no longer increase

## Skills Applied

The goal of this simple project was to apply DOM manipulation and event skills learned in the [JavaScript Basics](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#javascript-basics) section of the [Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) course. A secondary goal was to create a simple grid using css flexbox instead of css grid display using the skills learned from the [Flexbox](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#flexbox) section of the [Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) course.
